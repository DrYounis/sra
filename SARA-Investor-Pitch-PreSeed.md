# SARA — Investor Pitch Narrative
## Pre-Seed Round | 2026

---

## THE OPENING HOOK
### *What every investor hears first — in 60 seconds*

> **"Saudi Arabia has 13.2 million insured employees. 43% of them are on a trajectory toward diabetes, heart disease, or obesity. Each one costs their employer and insurer an average of SAR 8,500 per year in healthcare and lost productivity. That's a SAR 48 billion problem — and nobody has built a Saudi-native, clinically-backed solution to prevent it. Until now."**

---

## SLIDE 1: THE PROBLEM
### *Make the investor feel the pain before you offer the cure*

**Three crises converging at the same moment:**

Obesity rates in Saudi Arabia have reached 23.1% among individuals aged 15 and older, while 45.1% are considered overweight — making chronic lifestyle disease the single largest driver of corporate health costs in the Kingdom.

The average annual health insurance premium per person reached SAR 4,511 by end of 2024 — tripling since 2009 — with projections to reach SAR 9,500 by 2030.

**The corporate math is brutal:**

```
1,500-employee company today:
─────────────────────────────────────
Annual insurance premiums:      SAR 6.8M
Absenteeism (4.2 days avg):    SAR 1.9M
Productivity loss (15%):        SAR 3.4M
─────────────────────────────────────
Total cost of poor health:      SAR 12.1M/year

70% of this is PREVENTABLE.
That's SAR 8.5M that doesn't need to be spent.
```

---

## SLIDE 2: WHY NOW
### *The three tailwinds that make 2026 the perfect moment*

**Tailwind 1 — Regulatory Push**
Vision 2030's Health Sector Transformation Program allocated SR 180 billion in health and social development spending, with substantial commitment to digital healthcare initiatives and wellness promotion. The government is actively incentivizing exactly what SARA does.

**Tailwind 2 — Insurance Market Explosion**
Saudi Arabia's health insurance market is projected to nearly double from SAR 42 billion in 2024 to SAR 83 billion by 2030 — with insurers actively seeking wellness platforms to reduce loss ratios.

**Tailwind 3 — Digital Health Surge**
The Saudi Arabia digital health market, valued at USD 4.4 billion in 2024, is expected to reach USD 15.3 billion by 2033 at a CAGR of 13.20% — and wellness/telehealth add-ons are the fastest-growing segment at 18.52% CAGR.

**The window is open right now.** In 3 years it will be crowded. Today there is no Saudi-native, clinically-credible, AI-powered corporate wellness platform. SARA fills that gap.

---

## SLIDE 3: THE MARKET SIZE
### *TAM → SAM → SOM — the numbers that matter*

```
TAM — Total Addressable Market
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Saudi Health & Wellness Market (2024):     USD 35.3B
Saudi Health Insurance Market (2024):      SAR 42B
Combined opportunity:                      SAR 170B+

SAM — Serviceable Addressable Market
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Saudi Corporate Wellness Market (2024):    USD 791.8M  (SAR ~2.97B)
Projected by 2030:                         USD 2.5B    (SAR ~9.4B)
CAGR:                                      12%

SOM — SARA's Serviceable Obtainable Market (3 Years)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Target: Large employers (1,000+ employees) + insurers
Estimated 800+ qualifying employers in Saudi Arabia
SARA target: 5% market penetration by Year 3
= 40 employers x avg 2,000 employees x SAR 1,200/year
= SAR 96M ARR from employer channel alone
+ Insurer channel (3 partnerships x 15,000 members x SAR 300)
= SAR 13.5M additional ARR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SARA Year 3 SOM:  SAR 99M ARR  (conservative)
```

The health risk assessment segment holds the most significant share and is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR in Saudi Arabia's corporate wellness market — which is precisely SARA's core product entry point.

---

## SLIDE 4: THE SOLUTION — SARA
### *One platform. Three beneficiaries. Measurable outcomes.*

**SARA is the first Saudi-native corporate wellness platform that:**

```
FOR EMPLOYEES:
  - Clinically validated health assessment (44-condition framework)
  - Personalized 90-day lifestyle modification program
  - Arabic-first, culturally adapted, Islamically grounded
  - Walking-based — accessible to everyone, no gym required

FOR EMPLOYERS:
  - Real-time population health dashboard
  - ROI reporting in SAR — tied directly to claims & productivity
  - HR and C-suite reporting for Vision 2030 compliance
  - Measurable: absenteeism, engagement, and risk reduction

FOR INSURERS:
  - Loss ratio reduction tool — chronic claims prevention
  - Risk pool re-stratification data
  - Three revenue models: PMPY, Gain Share, Bundle
  - Premium pricing data for renewal negotiations
```

**The unfair advantage:** SARA is built on the 30-year research and methodology of **Dr. Salih Al-Ansari** — WHO physical activity guideline contributor, author of 5 published books, founder of Saudi Arabia's largest walking movement with 138,000+ followers, and the most credible voice in Gulf preventive health. No competitor can replicate this clinical foundation.

---

## SLIDE 5: TRACTION & VALIDATION
### *What we have today that de-risks the investment*

**Clinical Validation:**
- Dr. Salih Al-Ansari as clinical co-founder — brings 30 years of field-proven methodology
- 44-condition health assessment framework built from WHO-endorsed research
- 90-day intervention program designed and ready for deployment

**Market Validation:**
- Pricing model stress-tested against SAR 4,511 avg insurance premium
- ROI model shows 4x-12x return for employers at SAR 100 PEPM
- Gain-share model eliminates all financial risk for insurance partners

**Community Asset:**
- Dr. Alansari's 138,000 Twitter followers = built-in launch audience
- Riyadh Walkers community (2,000+ active members) = ready pilot group
- 100+ walking groups across Saudi Arabia = grassroots distribution

**Product Readiness:**
- Full MVP scope defined — 12-week build timeline
- Assessment engine, employee app, employer dashboard specified
- Brand identity complete — Arabic + English, culturally calibrated

**The Pitch Statement for Traction:**
> *"We haven't launched yet — but we have the clinical co-founder, the methodology, the market model, the brand, and the community. What we're raising now is the capital to build the product and run the pilot that turns this into an undeniable case study."*

```

---

## SLIDE 11: THE INVESTMENT THESIS
### *Why this is a rare opportunity — said plainly*

**1. Massive problem, no dominant local solution**
The Saudi corporate wellness market is worth USD 791M today and growing at 12% CAGR. The existing players — Virgin Pulse, Optum, Wellness360 — are Western platforms with no Saudi cultural adaptation, no Arabic-first experience, and no local clinical credibility. SARA is built from the inside out.

**2. The co-founder is the moat**
Dr. Alansari cannot be hired by a competitor. His 30-year research, his community of 138,000+ followers, his WHO recognition, and his institutional relationships are locked to SARA. This is a genuine unfair advantage that compounds over time.

**3. Dual revenue channel = faster path to profitability**
Most wellness startups depend on one buyer — the employer. SARA has two: the employer AND the insurer. The insurer channel is larger, stickier, and scales faster. One insurer deal = more revenue than 10 employer deals.

**4. Vision 2030 tailwind is structural, not cyclical**
This is not a trend — it is a national policy shift. The Saudi government has committed SAR 180 billion to health sector transformation. SARA is not swimming against the current; it is surfing a wave that the government is generating.

**5. The exit landscape is attractive**
Global corporate wellness companies (Omada Health, Noom, Lyra Health) have raised billions at high multiples. Regional strategic acquirers — Bupa Arabia, Tawuniya, Saudi Aramco Medical Services — are actively seeking preventive health platforms. SARA is being built to be acquired at the right moment, or to become the regional category leader.

---

## SLIDE 12: THE CLOSE
### *The one thing every investor must leave remembering*

> **"Saudi Arabia is building the healthiest workforce in the Arab world. SARA is the platform that makes that possible — one employee, one employer, one insurer at a time. We are raising SAR 2M to prove that with data. Join us."**
