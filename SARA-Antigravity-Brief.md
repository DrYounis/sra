# SARA — Full Project Brief for Antigravity
## Everything You Need to Build the SARA Website

---

## WHAT IS SARA

**SARA** (Smart • Adaptive • Restorative • Active) is Saudi Arabia's first clinically-backed, Arabic-native corporate wellness platform for chronic disease prevention. It targets large Saudi employers (1,000+ employees) and health insurance companies, helping them reduce the cost and burden of preventable chronic disease in the workforce.

**The Arabic meaning:** سارة — a woman's name meaning happiness and warmth. Chosen intentionally for Saudi cultural resonance.

---

## THE PROBLEM SARA SOLVES

- 43% of Saudi workforce is on a trajectory toward diabetes, heart disease, or obesity
- Each high-risk employee costs employers + insurers SAR 8,500/year
- Health insurance premiums tripled since 2009 (SAR 1,491 → SAR 4,511), projected SAR 9,500 by 2030
- 70% of chronic disease costs are PREVENTABLE through lifestyle modification
- No Saudi-native, clinically-backed platform exists to prevent it

---

## THE CLINICAL CO-FOUNDER

**Dr. Salih bin Saad Al-Ansari**

This is SARA's most important asset. He is not an advisor or endorser — he is a co-founder.

- WHO Physical Activity Guidelines Development Group contributor
- Assistant Professor, Family & Community Medicine — King Faisal University
- Former Director General, School Health — Ministry of Education (10 years)
- 5 published books on walking and preventive health
- Founder of Riyadh Walkers — Saudi Arabia's largest walking community (2,000+ members, 24 neighborhoods)
- 138,794 Twitter followers — most trusted preventive health voice in Saudi Arabia
- 30 years of health promotion experience
- Creator of the 44-condition framework linking walking to health outcomes

**Key concept:** "Walking Deficiency Syndrome" — his thesis that the chronic disease epidemic is solvable through movement and lifestyle modification.

## HOW SARA WORKS — THE THREE COMPONENTS

### 1. SARA ASSESS
A 44-question health risk assessment (15–20 minutes, Arabic + English, mobile-optimized). Generates a personal SARA Score (0–100) for each employee and a population risk map for employers.

**SARA Score levels:**
- 80–100: 🟢 Low Risk — maintain
- 60–79: 🟡 Moderate Risk — weekly program
- 40–59: 🟠 High Risk — 90-day intensive
- 0–39: 🔴 Critical Risk — clinical referral

**7 body systems assessed:**
1. Cardiovascular (25% weight)
2. Metabolic — diabetes, obesity (30% weight — highest)
3. Mental Health — stress, burnout (20% weight)
4. Musculoskeletal — back pain, joints (10% weight)
5. Respiratory (5% weight)
6. Cancer & Digestive (5% weight)
7. Lifestyle Factors — activity, nutrition, sleep (5% weight)

### 2. SARA COACH
A 90-day personalized lifestyle modification program built on Dr. Alansari's methodology. 5 daily pillars, 10 minutes total engagement per day:

- 🚶 **Movement** — walking-based, step goals, fajr walking philosophy
- 🍽️ **Nutrition** — Saudi-adapted (kabsa, harees, mandi healthy prep), half-plate rule
- 😴 **Sleep** — 7+ hours, القيلولة (Islamic nap as sunnah + health practice)
- 🧠 **Mental Health** — 3-min breathing, gratitude, stress management
- 🤝 **Community** — 8–12 person teams, leaderboards, health champions

**Program structure:**
- Phase 1 (Days 1–30): AWARENESS — "اعرف نفسك" — 5,000→7,000 steps/day
- Phase 2 (Days 31–60): BUILDING — "ابنِ عادتك" — 8,000→10,000 steps/day
- Phase 3 (Days 61–90): MASTERY — "عِش صحتك" — 10,000+ steps baseline

**Gamification badges:** 7-Day Streak, Hydration Hero, Dawn Walker, 10K Champion, SARA Graduate

**Islamic/Cultural integration:**
- Walking: النبي ﷺ "النسلان" (brisk walking) hadith
- Nutrition: ثلث طعام، ثلث شراب، ثلث نفس (one-third rule)
- Sleep: القيلولة as sunnah
- Gratitude: الشكر يزيد النعمة
- Ramadan: special 30-day adaptation module

### 3. SARA INSIGHTS
Real-time employer and insurer dashboard showing:
- Workforce risk distribution (% per risk level)
- Top risk categories
- Projected cost impact in SAR
- ROI tracking over time
- Insurance premium negotiation data

## THE SARA PITCH IN ONE PARAGRAPH (for about/investor pages)

"Saudi Arabia faces a workforce health crisis that Vision 2030 cannot afford to ignore. 43% of insured employees are on a trajectory toward diabetes, heart disease, or obesity — costing employers and insurers SAR 17 billion a year in preventable claims. SARA is Saudi Arabia's first clinically-backed, Arabic-native corporate wellness platform, built on 30 years of research by WHO contributor Dr. Salih Al-Ansari. We assess every employee's health risk across 44 conditions, then run a 90-day lifestyle modification program grounded in Saudi culture and Islamic values. Our employer dashboard shows ROI in SAR. Our insurer dashboard reduces loss ratios. This is not a wellness app. This is Saudi Arabia's prevention infrastructure."
