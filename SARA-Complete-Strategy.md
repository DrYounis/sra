## 2. Business Model Canvas

### What SARA Is
A **Corporate Wellness & Lifestyle Modification Platform** that reduces chronic disease risk in large employee populations — saving insurance companies money on claims, and saving companies money on sick leave, productivity loss, and rising premium costs.

### The Core Concept
> "We help large Saudi employers and their insurers cut chronic disease costs by identifying at-risk employees early and guiding them through measurable lifestyle change — before they become expensive patients."

### The 3-Sided Value Proposition

```
EMPLOYEE    →  healthier lifestyle, better quality of life
EMPLOYER    →  lower absenteeism, higher productivity, lower insurance premiums
INSURANCE   →  lower loss ratio, fewer chronic claims, better risk pool
```

### The Repositioning

**Old positioning** (what most wellness apps say):
> "We help your employees be healthier"

**New positioning:**
> "We reduce your group insurance loss ratio and cut chronic disease costs by up to 40% — measurably, in 12 months"

This shifts the conversation from HR budget (small, discretionary) to CFO + insurance budget (large, strategic).

### Canvas Elements

| Element | Details |
|---|---|
| **Product Type** | Corporate Wellness & Lifestyle Modification SaaS |
| **Core Function** | Health assessments → behavior change → chronic disease prevention |
| **Target** | Large employers (1000+ employees) + Charities |
| **Revenue Model** | Split — Employer pays + Insurer pays |
| **Market** | Saudi Arabia (Vision 2030 aligned) |
| **Stage** | Conceptual — building now |
| **Goal** | First clients + Investors + Recurring revenue + Scale |

### Customer Segments

**Primary Buyers (who pay):**
- Large corporations 1,000+ employees with group insurance
- Insurance companies / TPAs managing high loss ratios
- Large charities and NGOs (entry point for credibility)

**End Users (who use it daily):**
- Employees / beneficiaries on the health platform

### Buyer Matrix

| Role | Who They Are | What They Care About |
|---|---|---|
| Economic Buyer | CFO / CEO | ROI, cost savings, compliance risk |
| Technical Buyer | IT / CTO | Integration, security, data privacy |
| End User | Employee | Ease of use, cultural relevance |
| Influencer | Medical director / HR | Clinical accuracy, employee wellbeing |

### Value Propositions

**For the Employer (HR / CFO):**
- Reduce sick days and absenteeism
- Lower annual insurance premium renewals
- Fulfill Vision 2030 employee wellbeing mandate
- Measurable ROI dashboard in SAR

**For the Insurance Company:**
- Lower loss ratio on group policies
- Early risk stratification of member population
- Data to reprice or restructure group contracts
- Competitive advantage offering wellness to corporate clients

**For the Employee:**

### Revenue Streams (Split Model)

| Stream | Who Pays | Model | Estimated Range |

| Risk management fee | Insurance co. | Per member / year or % of savings | 200-500 SAR per member |
| Setup & onboarding | Employer | One-time fee | 15,000-50,000 SAR |
| Premium analytics | Insurer | Add-on module | Custom enterprise pricing |

2. **Arabic-first** — built for Saudi culture, not translated
3. **Split revenue model** — aligns incentives of employer + insurer
4. **Charity pilot** — real data + social proof fast

6. **Measurable ROI** — tied directly to insurance claims reduction

## 3. MVP Scope & Roadmap

### The Golden Rule
> Don't build a product. Build a proof of ROI.

The MVP needs to answer one question:
> "Can this platform identify at-risk employees and show measurable behavior change in 90 days?"

### MVP Philosophy: 3 Layers

```
LAYER 3 — Scale    →  AI coaching, wearables, insurer integration  (Month 12+)
LAYER 2 — Grow     →  dashboards, ROI reporting, HR portal          (Month 4-6)
LAYER 1 — PROVE    →  assessment + risk score + basic guidance      (Month 1-3)
```

### Core Module 1: Health Assessment Engine

**What it does:**
- Employee fills a digital health assessment (15-20 min)
- Covers: BMI, blood pressure history, diet habits, activity level, stress, sleep, smoking, family history
- Generates Personal Risk Score (Low / Medium / High)
- Employee gets clear health report in Arabic

**Why first:** Zero clinical liability, gives real data immediately, creates the "wow moment"

### Core Module 2: Population Risk Dashboard (Employer View)

**What it shows:**
- % of workforce at low / medium / high risk
- Top 3 health risk categories across the company
- Projected cost impact if nothing changes (in SAR)
- Comparison to Saudi national benchmarks

**Why it matters:** This is your sales tool AND your product simultaneously

### Core Module 3: Lifestyle Guidance Engine

**What it does:**
- Based on risk score, assigns personalized lifestyle program
- Weekly micro-habits in Arabic (nutrition, movement, sleep, stress)
- Culturally relevant — accounts for Ramadan, Saudi diet, prayer routine
- Progress check-in every 2 weeks

### What NOT to Build in MVP

| Feature | Why Skip It Now |
|---|---|
| Wearable integration | Complex, expensive, not needed to prove concept |
| Insurance company portal | Sell to employer first, bring insurer later |
| Full AI coaching engine | Rule-based works for MVP, AI comes with data |
| Clinic/hospital referral | Legal complexity, save for V2 |
| Custom white-label | Standardize first, customize later |

### MVP Technical Stack

| Component | What It Is | Complexity |
|---|---|---|
| Assessment form engine | Dynamic questionnaire with scoring logic | Low |
| Risk scoring algorithm | Rule-based health risk calculator | Low-Medium |
| Employee mobile app | iOS + Android or Progressive Web App | Medium |
| Employer web dashboard | Simple analytics portal | Medium |
| Notification system | Push + WhatsApp/SMS reminders | Low |
| Admin panel | Manage companies, users, reports | Low |

**Total MVP build time:** 3-4 months with 2 developers + 1 designer + clinical advisor

### 12-Week MVP Roadmap

| Weeks | Focus |
|---|---|
| 1-2 | Finalize assessment questions with clinical advisor. Design risk scoring model. |
| 3-4 | Build assessment form + scoring engine. Design employer dashboard wireframes. |
| 5-6 | Build employer dashboard. Arabic UI for employee app. |
| 7-8 | Build lifestyle guidance content (Arabic). Notification system. |
| 9-10 | Internal testing. Fix bugs. Prepare pilot materials. |
| 11-12 | Launch charity pilot. Collect data. Build case study. |

### Pilot Strategy — Charity as Launch Pad

1. Offer free 90-day pilot to one large charity (1,000+ beneficiaries/staff)
2. Run the assessment, collect real population health data
3. Generate a real ROI report showing risk levels and projected cost impact
4. Use that report as sales deck for first paying corporate client
5. Walk into insurance company with real Saudi population data

### Definition of MVP Success

> "We screened 1,000+ employees, identified that 34% are at high risk for chronic disease, and after 90 days of our program, 60% of high-risk participants improved at least one lifestyle metric — representing an estimated 2.1M SAR in avoided future claims."

## The SARA Pitch in One Paragraph

> "Saudi Arabia faces a workforce health crisis that Vision 2030 cannot afford to ignore. 43% of insured employees are on a trajectory toward diabetes, heart disease, or obesity — costing employers and insurers SAR 17 billion a year in preventable claims. SARA is Saudi Arabia's first clinically-backed, Arabic-native corporate wellness platform, built on 30 years of research by WHO contributor Dr. Salih Al-Ansari. We assess every employee's health risk across 44 conditions, then run a 90-day lifestyle modification program grounded in Saudi culture and Islamic values. Our employer dashboard shows ROI in SAR. Our insurer dashboard reduces loss ratios. This is not a wellness app. This is Saudi Arabia's prevention infrastructure."
