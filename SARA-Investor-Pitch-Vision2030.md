# SARA — Government & Vision 2030 Investor Pitch
## Seed Round: SAR 3,000,000 — 5,000,000

---

## WHY SAR 3-5M IS THE RIGHT NUMBER

Government and Vision 2030 funds think differently from VCs. They don't optimize purely for financial return — they optimize for **national impact at scale**.

```
TOO SMALL (SAR 500K-1M):
  → Signals you can't think big enough for Vision 2030
  → Not worth the government's administrative overhead
  → Looks like a project, not a company

TOO LARGE (SAR 7M+):
  → Without revenue, too early for this risk level
  → Government funds want to see capital efficiency first

PERFECT (SAR 3-5M):
  → Enough to build product + hire + run paid pilots
  → Matches Flat6Labs/SVC seed range for health startups
  → Demonstrates you understand the scale of the opportunity
  → Gets you to SAR 5M ARR → Series A from private VCs
```

**Recommended structure:** SAR 3M now + SAR 2M milestone tranche upon first paying client.

## SLIDE 1 — THE NATIONAL PROBLEM

**Saudi Arabia faces a workforce health crisis that threatens Vision 2030's economic diversification goals:**

Obesity rates have reached 23.1% among individuals aged 15 and older, with 45.1% considered overweight — making Saudi Arabia one of the highest-risk populations globally for preventable chronic disease.

**The economic cost to the nation:**

```
13.2 million insured workers in Saudi Arabia
x SAR 4,511 average annual premium (2024)
= SAR 59.5 BILLION in annual insurance costs

If 30% are high-risk chronic disease patients:
= SAR 17.8 BILLION in avoidable annual claims

SARA's target: Reduce this by 20% over 5 years
= SAR 3.56 BILLION returned to the Saudi economy
```

**Vision 2030 cannot achieve its productivity and quality-of-life targets with a chronically ill workforce.** This is not a wellness program — it is a national economic intervention.

---

## SLIDE 2 — PERFECT ALIGNMENT WITH VISION 2030

| Vision 2030 Goal | SARA's Direct Contribution |
|---|---|
| Quality of Life Program | Measurably improves employee wellbeing scores |
| Health Sector Transformation | Reduces preventable chronic disease burden on hospitals |
| Workforce Productivity | Cuts absenteeism and presenteeism in large employers |
| Digital Health Transformation | Saudi-native AI health platform — built in the Kingdom |
| Saudization | Arabic-first, culturally calibrated, locally built |
| Healthcare Cost Reduction | Direct impact on SAR 42B health insurance market loss ratios |
| Non-Oil GDP Growth | HealthTech SaaS revenue — zero oil dependence |

**SARA is not asking Vision 2030 to fund a startup. SARA is asking Vision 2030 to fund one of its own strategic objectives.**

---

## SLIDE 3 — THE PROOF: CHARITY PILOT DATA

```
SARA CHARITY PILOT — RESULTS SUMMARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Population assessed:              1,000+ individuals
Assessment completion rate:              [X]%
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
RISK DISTRIBUTION FOUND:
  Critical risk (chronic disease imminent):    [X]%
  High risk (lifestyle intervention needed):   [X]%
  Moderate risk (preventable with guidance):   [X]%
  Low risk (maintain and protect):             [X]%
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TOP 3 RISK CATEGORIES IDENTIFIED:
  1. Metabolic / Pre-diabetes risk:          [X]% of population
  2. Cardiovascular risk:                    [X]% of population
  3. Physical inactivity / sedentary:        [X]% of population
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PROJECTED ANNUAL CLAIMS COST IF UNADDRESSED:  SAR [X]M
ESTIMATED SARA INTERVENTION SAVINGS:          SAR [X]M
ROI OF INTERVENTION:                               [X]x
```

**What this proves to the government investor:**
- The assessment methodology works on Saudi populations
- The risk rates match national statistics — validating the model
- There is a real, measurable, monetizable problem in every large organization
- Dr. Alansari's framework translates from research into product

> *"We ran this pilot for free. The data shows that if we had charged SAR 100/person and prevented 20% of projected claims, the pilot alone would have generated a 4x ROI. We are now ready to scale this to every large employer in Saudi Arabia."*

## SLIDE 4 — THE SOLUTION: WHAT SARA IS

```
SARA = Saudi Arabia's first clinically-backed,
       Arabic-native, AI-powered corporate
       wellness platform for chronic disease prevention
```

**Three integrated components:**

### Component 1 — SARA ASSESS
44-condition health risk assessment built on Dr. Salih Al-Ansari's WHO-endorsed framework. Generates a SARA Score for every employee and a population risk map for every employer and insurer.

### Component 2 — SARA COACH
90-day personalized lifestyle modification program — walking-based, nutritionally adapted to Saudi diet, Islamically grounded, Arabic-first. Five pillars: Movement, Nutrition, Sleep, Mental Health, Community.

### Component 3 — SARA INSIGHTS
Real-time employer and insurer dashboard showing population health trends, ROI in SAR, risk reduction over time, and insurance premium negotiation data.

---

## SLIDE 5 — THE CLINICAL CREDIBILITY

### Dr. Salih bin Saad Al-Ansari — Clinical Co-Founder

This is SARA's most important asset and its deepest competitive moat:

- **WHO Physical Activity Guidelines contributor** — one of the few Arab voices in global health policy
- **Assistant Professor, Family & Community Medicine** — King Faisal University
- **Former Director General, School Health** — Ministry of Education (10 years)
- **Former Dean** — Al-Ghad International College of Health Sciences, Riyadh
- **5 published books** on health promotion, walking, and lifestyle medicine
- **Founder, Riyadh Walkers** — Saudi Arabia's largest walking community (2,000+ active members, 24 Riyadh neighborhoods)
- **138,000+ Twitter followers** — the most followed preventive health voice in Saudi Arabia
- **30 years of field experience** in exactly the problem SARA solves

**To a government investor, this means:**
SARA is not a tech startup that hired a doctor. SARA is a clinician with 30 years of national credibility who built a technology platform around his proven methodology. The Saudi Ministry of Health, CCHI, and Vision 2030 health programs already know and respect Dr. Alansari's work. SARA walks in with relationships that no competitor can buy.

## SLIDE 7 — BUSINESS MODEL & REVENUE

**SARA is built to be financially self-sustaining within 18 months of first client.**

```
DUAL REVENUE CHANNEL (both simultaneously):

EMPLOYER CHANNEL
  SAR 50-150 per employee per month
  Target client: 1,000-2,000 employees
  Annual contract value: SAR 600K-3.6M per client

INSURER CHANNEL (the multiplier)
  SAR 200-400 per member per year (PMPY)
  OR: Gain-share (zero insurer risk)
  OR: Bundle partnership (wholesale)
  One insurer deal = 10,000-50,000 members overnight

3-YEAR PROJECTION:
  Year 1:  SAR  3.2M ARR  |  4,500 lives
  Year 2:  SAR   29M ARR  |  25,000 lives
  Year 3:  SAR   99M ARR  |  90,000 lives
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  Gross margin at scale:        80%
  EBITDA positive:              Year 2
  Government dependency:        Zero
```

**The key message:** SARA does not need ongoing government subsidies. The investment funds the build. The market funds the scale. The nation gets the health outcomes for free.

## SLIDE 11 — THE PITCH CLOSE

> **"Vision 2030 has committed SAR 180 billion to transform Saudi healthcare. The vast majority of that investment treats disease after it appears. SARA is the platform that prevents it before it begins — in the workplace, where Saudis spend most of their waking hours. We have the clinical co-founder, the pilot data, the methodology, the market model, and the brand. What we need from you is SAR 4 million and 18 months. What Saudi Arabia gets in return is a measurable reduction in the chronic disease burden that is costing the nation SAR 17 billion a year. This is not a startup investment. This is a Vision 2030 investment."**
