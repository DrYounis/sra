## What is SARA?

SARA helps large Saudi employers (1,000+ employees) and health insurers **reduce chronic disease costs** by identifying at-risk employees early and guiding them through a 90-day lifestyle modification program — built on Dr. Salih Al-Ansari's 30-year walking methodology.

**The problem:** 43% of Saudi workforce heading toward diabetes, heart disease, obesity. Costs SAR 17.8B/year in preventable claims.

**The solution:** Assess (44 conditions) → Coach (90-day program) → Insights (ROI dashboard in SAR)
